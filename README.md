### Hi there 👋 I am Alan.

*	🏫 I am a graduate student in the Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) program at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science. ~~This program is just...fine🙃. I wish there were more time to do the things we want.~~
* 🎓 I graduated with a dual BS degree in Data Science from Duke Kunshan University in Suzhou (Soochow, 苏州), China, and a BS from Duke University (great times in Durham, NC🍂).
* 📖 I am interested in exploring late modern period history, political economy, and public transportation.
* 🧑‍💻 For serious stuff, I worked on several interesting projects at CMU. Some notable ones include building part of the data pipeline and backend for an LMS, and I am thinking about how to make it more scalable. I was also involved in two startup projects, though both development teams feel a bit chaotic :).
* 🧑‍💻 Learning a lot about building systems and LLM applications. 日本語を勉強しています。
* 🏃 Frequent traveler✈️. Managed to spend less than 7 hours traveling from my apartment in PGH to NHV🙃. Spent Summer 2024 in Providence, RI🌊. Good times there.
* 🧑‍💻 Developing my personal site. Check out alanvoid.com
