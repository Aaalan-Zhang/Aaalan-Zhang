### Hi there 👋

* 🏫 I am a graduate student in the Master of Computational Data Science program @ Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science.
  ~~This program is just, fine🙃.~~
* 🎓 I graduated with a dual BS degree in Data Science from Duke Kunshan University in Suzhou (Soochow, 苏州), China, and a BS from Duke University (good time in Durham, NC🍂).
* 📖 Interested in exploring late modern period history, political economy, and public transportation.
* 🧑‍💻 For serious stuff, currently working on the data pipeline and backend for an E-learning platform. I am thinking about how to make it more scalable. The other stuff is for flask development, well, that's only a small part of an overly complicated project.
* 🧑‍💻 Learning a lot of systems knowledge and some LLM knowledge. 日本語を勉強しています。
* 🏃 Frequent traveler✈️. Successfully spent less than 7 hours from my apartment in PGH to NHV🙃. Spent Summer 2024 in Providence, RI🌊. Good time there.
* 🥲 Struggling to find a job.
* 🧑‍💻 Developing my personal site. Checkout chenglinzhang.com.😄
