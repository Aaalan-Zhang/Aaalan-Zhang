### Hi there 👋
I am a graduate student in the Master of Computational Data Science program @ CMU SCS.
~~Well, this graduate program is just, fine.~~

I graduated with a BS in Data Science from Duke Kunshan University in Suzhou, China.
(and a BS from Duke University, good time in Durham, NC)

Currently trying to spend less than 7 hours traveling 370mi from my apartment to New Haven, CT.
