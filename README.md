### Hi there 👋
* 🏫 I am a graduate student in the Master of Computational Data Science program @ CMU SCS.
~~This program is just, fine🙃.~~
*  🎓 I graduated with a BS in Data Science from Duke Kunshan University in Suzhou, China
(and a BS from Duke University, good time in Durham, NC🍂).
* 🏃 Currently trying to spend less than 7 hours traveling 370mi from my apartment to New Haven, CT.
